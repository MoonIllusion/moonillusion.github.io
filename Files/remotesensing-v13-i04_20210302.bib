ABSTRACT = {As pre-launch antenna calibrations are not available for GPS and GLONASS satellites, the high correlation between the terrestrial scale and phase center offset (PCO) prevents a reliable estimation of the terrestrial scale with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) technology. Fortunately, the ground calibrated PCO values for Galileo, BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS), and QZSS have been released, making a reliable estimation of the terrestrial scale with GNSS possible. In the third reprocess (repro3) of International GNSS Service (IGS), the terrestrial scale derived with Galileo, has been used. To evaluate the consistency of the terrestrial scale derived from the BDS-released PCOs as well as Galileo-released ones, and to incorporate BDS into IGS repro3 as well as operational legacy analysis, the phase center variations (PCV) and PCO for BDS medium earth orbit (MEO) and inclined geostationary orbit (IGSO) satellites are estimated to be consistent with GPS/GLONASS antenna offsets in two frames, i.e., IGb14 and IGS R3, considering robot calibrations of the ground receiver antenna models for BDS released by Geo++. We observe that the average offset of Z-PCOs achieves +98.8 mm between BDS official released and the estimated PCOs in IGb14 frame for BDS-3 MEO satellites, whereas the average offset for Z-PCO is about +174.1 mm (about −1.27 ppb at the height of BDS MEO satellites) between the solutions in IGSR3 and IGb14 frame. The phase center solutions are evaluated with orbit boundary disclosures (OBD) as well as the global station coordinates. The orbit consistency benefits from the PCO/PCV estimates, particularly for BDS-2 MEO satellites, of which the 3D RMS (root mean square) OBD is reduced by 50%, whereas 3D OBD achieves about 90.0 mm for BDS-3 MEO satellites. Moreover, the scale bias between BDS-derived station coordinates and IGS legacy solutions in IGb14 frame is reduced from +0.446 ± 0.153 ppb to +0.012 ± 0.112 ppb using PCO/PCV estimates in IGb14, instead of the BDS official released values. Additionally, the residuals of the BDS-derived station heights (after the Helmert transformation) are slightly reduced from 9.65 to 8.62 mm. On the other hand, about +0.226 ± 0.175 ppb is observed between BDS-only coordinate solutions derived from PCO/PCV estimates in IGSR3 frame and the IGS repro3 initial combination. These results demonstrate that the scale inconsistency derived from BDS and Galileo released PCOs is about +1.854 ± 0.191 ppb, and a good consistency of PCO/PCC estimates for BDS in IGb14 and IGSR3 frame with other systems of GPS/ GLONASS antenna offsets is achieved.},
